                    <p>
                        Believe it or not, jazz started out as pop. It was one the most popular genres in 1920s America.
                        It was created from a fusion of ragtime, European chamber elements, marching band music, and the
                        blues.

                    <p>
                        The precise origin of the word "jazz" is a mystery. No one knows exactly where it came from,
                        although there are many speculations. Some say that it was originally a slang word that was
                        spelled in many different ways: jaz, jas, jass, and jasz.

                    <p>
                        As you know if you are a musician, there are many ways that we communicate. When jazz players
                        are performing together, they will often nod to signal the end of the piece or point their
                        fingers at their heads. When they do the latter, it's because it's time to play the head: the
                        first and last chorus of a song.

                        Believe it or not, jazz is becoming popular again. There are quite a few very successful jazz

                    <p>
                        If you're struggling with motivation, it might be time to listen to some John Coltrane or
                        Charlie Parker. This will likely inspire you to complete your latest project. Listening to jazz
                        music activates your most highly creative (theta) brain waves.
